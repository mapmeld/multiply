Chicago's bike-share program, Divvy, has a site open for citizens to suggest station locations.

<a href="https://github.com/stevevance">Steve Vance</a> has been archiving the site so that we can analyze interest in Divvy over time.

Each commit is backdated to the date data was retrieved from the site.

Each diff uses GitHub's new geospatial diffs for comparison. One looks like this:

I'm not affiliated with Divvy or the City of Chicago. Just hacking.
